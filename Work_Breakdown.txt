Kevin's NOTES
All database items are being added/initialized on each call or refresh of the Dev page.
- implement initData() function at home page to input initial data into database
- may need to clear all tuples and initialize again if home page refreshes (or just run init_table.sql again)
- delete calls to new items from the dev page
